                Hey there, Gift here. Currently a DirectEd Scholar aspiring to
                work at a western tech firm. Born in the village outskirts of
                Kisumu Town, Kenya, I had a humble beginning and background.
                Currently, I reside in Nairobi City. I have always wanted to
                learn programming hence was really excited to hear about
                DirectEd and how they can transform my life. I decided to join
                their boot camp because this was once in a lifetime opportunity
                and through them, I will be able to achieve my dream to become a
                software engineer.

                Want to learn more about my education? I first undertook my

                <strong>Good Testimony Junior School</strong> in Nairobi for my primary
                education where I managed to score <strong>429 marks</strong> out the possible 500 in
                the KCPE then later enrolled in <strong>Mang'u High School</strong>. I
                was sharp and managed to get an
                <strong>A of 83 points</strong> out of the possible 84 points in the KCSE.

                My family and I love helping the less fortunate in our community
                so whenever we go to our rural area we always ensure to buy
                goods for our less fortunate neighbors and enjoy Christmas with
                them. I save up money during the year to buy them clothing and
                food to enjoy at Christmas. Back in High school, I was also a
                member of <strong>The Presidential Award Society</strong> where
                we would each contribute money to renovate a children's home,
                buy food for them among other things.
