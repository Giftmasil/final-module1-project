                <p>My family and I love helping hte lesss fortunate in our community so whenever we go to our rural area we always ensure to buy goods for our less fortunate neighbours and enjoy chrismas with them. I save up money during the year to buy them clothing and food to enjoy at chrismas.</p>
                <p>I was also at <strong>Presidential Award Society</strong> where we would visit children homes and we each contributed money and went to there and layed tiles on the floor in the house they sleep</p>
