                        <p class="mb-4">My family and I love helping the less fortunate in our community so whenever we go to our rural area we always ensure to buy goods for our less fortunate neighbors and enjoy Christmas with them. I save up money during the year to buy them clothing and food to enjoy at Christmas. Back in High school, I was also a member of <strong>The Presidential Award Society</strong> where we would each contribute money to renovate a children's home, buy food for them among other things.</p>
